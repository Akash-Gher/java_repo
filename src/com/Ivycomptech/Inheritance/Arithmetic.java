package com.Ivycomptech.Inheritance;

class Arithmetic {
    /*
  Write the following code in your editor below:
1.	A class named com.Ivycomptech.Inheritance.Arithmetic with a method named add that takes  2 integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum.
2.	A class named com.Ivycomptech.Inheritance.Adder inherits from a superclass named com.Ivycomptech.Inheritance.Arithmetic.
Your classes should not be public.
Input Format
You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin; a locked code stub will test your submission by calling the add method on an com.Ivycomptech.Inheritance.Adder object and passing it 2 integer parameters.
Output Format
You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. Your add method must return the sum of its parameters.
Sample Output
The main method in the Solution class above should print the following:
My superclass is: com.Ivycomptech.Inheritance.Arithmetic
42 13 20


     */
    //add method
    int add(int a, int b){
     return a+b;

    }


}
